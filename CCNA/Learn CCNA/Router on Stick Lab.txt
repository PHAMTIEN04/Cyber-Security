Configure Router on a stick as follows:
1) VLAN 1 = 10.1.1.0/24, VLAN 10 = 10.1.10.0/24, VLAN 20 = 10.1.20.0/24
2) Router = last IP address in subnet
3) Switch = 10.1.1.253/24 only
Configure VLANs on switch (PC1 in VLAN 10 and PC2 in VLAN 20)
4) Configure link between switch and router
5) Make sure PC1 can ping PC2 (PC1 = 10.1.10.1) PC2 = 10.1.20.2)
****************************************************************************
To configure a router on a stick with VLANs and enable communication between PC1 and PC2, you'll need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Create VLANs on the Switch**

Log into your switch and enter configuration mode. The specific commands may vary depending on your switch's operating system, but the general idea is:

```shell
enable
configure terminal

vlan 10
name VLAN10
exit

vlan 20
name VLAN20
exit

interface GigabitEthernet0/1  # This is the interface connecting to the router
switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
switchport mode trunk
exit

interface GigabitEthernet0/2  # This is the interface connecting to PC1
switchport access vlan 10
exit

interface GigabitEthernet0/3  # This is the interface connecting to PC2
switchport access vlan 20
exit

end
```

**Step 2: Configure the Router**

Log into your router and enter configuration mode. Again, the commands may vary depending on your router's OS, but here's a general idea:

```shell
enable
configure terminal

interface GigabitEthernet0/0.1  # Subinterface for VLAN 1
encapsulation dot1Q 1
ip address 10.1.1.253 255.255.255.0
exit

interface GigabitEthernet0/0.10  # Subinterface for VLAN 10
encapsulation dot1Q 10
ip address 10.1.10.254 255.255.255.0
exit

interface GigabitEthernet0/0.20  # Subinterface for VLAN 20
encapsulation dot1Q 20
ip address 10.1.20.254 255.255.255.0
exit

end
```

**Step 3: Verify Connectivity**

Now, you should have the following:

- PC1 in VLAN 10 with IP address 10.1.10.1.
- PC2 in VLAN 20 with IP address 10.1.20.2.

You should be able to ping from PC1 to PC2. Open a command prompt on PC1 and run:

```shell
ping 10.1.20.2
```

If everything is configured correctly, PC1 should be able to ping PC2 successfully.

These configurations assume that your router and switch are set up with the correct VLAN trunking configuration, and the PCs are correctly connected to the respective switch ports. Also, ensure that the PCs have their default gateways set to the appropriate router subinterface IP addresses for their VLANs (e.g., PC1's default gateway should be set to 10.1.10.254).
